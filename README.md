This research introduces a novel self-supervised deep learning framework for the accurate diagnosis of meniscus tears using MRI images. The proposed  method addresses the limitations of traditional supervised learning approaches by effectively utilizing unlabeled  data to pre-train a convolutional neural network (CNN).
