This research introduces a novel self-supervised deep learning framework for the accurate diagnosis of meniscus tears using MRI images. The proposed  method addresses the limitations of traditional supervised learning approaches by effectively utilizing unlabeled  data to pre-train a convolutional neural network (CNN). 
"The dataset for this research was sourced from Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran. Due to the confidential nature of the medical records, public dissemination of the raw data is restricted."
